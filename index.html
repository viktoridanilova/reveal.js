						<h2>The architecture</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Components</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Components define <i>views</i>, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data</li>
							<li>Components use <i>services</i>, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be <i>injected</i> into components as <i>dependencies</i>, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Modules, components and services are classes that use <i>decorators</i>. These decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>
						<p>An application's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>

						<h3>Modules</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Angular <i>NgModules</i> differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Components</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Every Angular application has at least one component, the <i>root component</i> that connects a component hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM).
					</section>
					<section>
						***Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. Angular defines a number of decorators that attach specific kinds of metadata to classes, so that the system knows what those classes mean and how they should work.

						<h3>Templates, directives, and data binding</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>There are two types of data binding:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Event binding</li>
							<li>Property binding</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

						<h3>Services and dependency injection</h3>
					</section>
					<section>For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you create a <i>service</i> class.</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Routing</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The Angular Router NgModule provides a service that lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your application. It is modeled on the familiar browser navigation conventions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Enter a URL in the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page</li>
							<li>Click links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page</li>
							<li>Click the browser's back and forward buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages you've seen</li>
						</ul>
